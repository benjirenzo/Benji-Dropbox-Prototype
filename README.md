# Benji-Dropbox-Prototype
Week 1 iOS for Designers

Total Hours: ~8hours

All required:
— Welcome flow
— Able to go thru the sign in or create account flow
— Forgot password sheet via modal segue
— Terms via modal segue
— Tab controllers for existing and new user
— Sign out to sign in screen from settings

Optional:
— User can page swipe through the welcome screens.
**Inserted page controller and tried to program it to chage according to the page of the welcome flow. Got it to work on a 
separate file but not on my actual prototype. In either case I was not able to get the page controller to stay in page
as I swiped through the welcome flow.
